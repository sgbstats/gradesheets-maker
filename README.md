# gradesheets-maker
A smol repo for making gradesheets and then converting the finished ones to pdfs. This should preserve any formulas that you have in your templates.

Feel free to use this how you like but do expect issues down the line. Either fix them yourself (and contribute to this repo) or let me know and I can work on a fix.

This is run using VBA. It has been made on Windows but I can't see why it won't run on mac.

## Before you start

- Enable developer mode on Excel [(File, Options, Customize the Ribbon, tick Developer)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/show-the-developer-tab-e1192344-5e56-4d45-931b-e5fd9bea2d45)
- Save the two .bas files in the gradesheetmaker and pdfmaker folders to your machine
- Open a blank Excel file and save (anywhere) as a .xlsm (macro enabled) file
- Click on the Developer tab then Visual Basic which opens a new window

 ![Right click the modules folder on the left](img/img1.png)

- Choose import and pick each of the two .bas files (need to do this twice)

- Once you have imported the modules and saved the blank file, you should be able to reopen it with any changes to the modules already saved.

- If you want to share the module, right click it on the left and press export. 

### Maybe save the files in the tutorial folder and have a go before you use actual students names etc.
